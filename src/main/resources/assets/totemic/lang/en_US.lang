totemic.entry.cedarTree=The Red Cedar tree
totemic.page.cedarTree0=The great Red Cedar Tree, one of the strongest, and most powerful trees in existence. It's wood is the base of most Totemic practice, and has properties that many other trees do not. To create the sapling of this tree, you need to just use the &1Cedar Metamorphesiser&0 on a sapling in the world.
totemic.page.cedarTree1=The height of the Red Cedar tree is usually from 6 to 9 blocks, but of course that can vary. The tree drops saplings like normal trees, and performs all other normal sapling behaviour.

totemic.entry.buffaloBasic=Buffaloes
totemic.page.buffaloBasic0=The mighty Buffalo, an animal which is known across the lands for the resources it can grant, and the powers it wields. Buffaloes can be found in the world, or later 'created' through a Ceremony. They are incredibly sturdy and have a very large amount of health.

totemic.entry.creatingTotems=Totem Poles
totemic.page.creatingTotems0=Creating a Totem Pole is a very simple thing to do. First you must create a &1Totem Whittling Knife&0, this will be what you use to carve out your Totem Poles.

totemic.entry.instruments=Instruments
totemic.page.instruments0=Instruments are a way to create &4Musical Melody&0, which is a type of power that many blocks and systems require, such as the &1Totem Base&0 and even &4Ceremonies&0. When played, all instruments will output their music to the first available nearby block that can accept it. Each instrument will produce &4Musical Melody&0 in very many different ways, with different outputs and ranges.

totemic.entry.performingCeremonies=Performing Ceremonies
totemic.page.performingCeremonies0=&4Ceremonies&0 are a way for a Totemist to gather strength over a period of time through the power of music, and other acts to release as a central burst of effects. The centre of a &4Ceremony&0 is a &1Totem Base&0, all music and other things are centered to the &1Totem Pole&0 and it is where the effects are released from.
totemic.page.performingCeremonies1=To perform a &4Ceremony&0, there are a few things you must do. To select and initiate your &4Ceremony&0, you must play 4 Instruments in their selector mode to a &1Totem Pole&0. To play most Instruments in a selector mode, just play them normally while shifting. When you have played 4 corresponding instruments for a &4Ceremony&0, the startup will initiate.
totemic.page.performingCeremonies2=While it is in this startup mode, the &1Totem Pole&0 will accept all nearby music and store it. This is called &4Musical Melody&0 and it is what is needed for the &4Ceremonies&0 effect to activate. When the total &4Musical Melody&0 hits the threshold of the &4Ceremonies&0 Melody requirement, it will activate the effect.
totemic.page.performingCeremonies3=Not all &4Ceremonies&0 end instantly after the startup, though. Instead the effects will last over a certain amount of time after the effect initially starts. Doing the effects will drain the &4Musical Melody&0 though, and the effects can only go for a certain amount of time and will stop after that time has elapsed.

totemic.entry.rainDance=Rain Dance Ceremony
totemic.page.rainDance0=The &4Rain Dance Ceremony&0 is a way for you to bring a torrent of rain into the world. If the rain becomes too much to bare, the &4Drought Ceremony&0 is always available, which will remove all rain. Because the effects of this &4Ceremony&0 are so potent, it may be hard to perform.
totemic.page.rainDance1=&oLike a Politoed&r.

totemic.entry.drought=Drought Ceremony
totemic.page.drought0=
totemic.page.drought1=&oNinetails, Not Kurama!&r

totemic.entry.barkStripper=Bark Stripper
totemic.page.barkStripper0=The &1Bark Stripper&0 is a way for you to collect the bark from your &1Red Cedar Logs&0 and reveal stripped wood from the tree. To do so, just hold the &1Bark Stripper&0 in your hand, and right click on the log, after a few seconds it will finish stripping the bark from the log, revealing the stripped log and creating the bark.
totemic.page.barkStripper1=There are many uses for both the bark and the stripped log. The &1Red Cedar Stripped Log&0 can be crafted into planks at a more efficient rate, and can be put in a furnace to create charcoal. While the bark is a crafting component for many blocks and items, usually to reinforce items.

totemic.entry.blowDart=Blow Dart
totemic.page.blowDart0=The Blow Dart is a ranged weapon, akin to a &1Bow&0, but unlike the &1Bow&0, this weapons projectiles can be coated for certain effects on impact. It functions the same as the bow with everything but the projectiles. The projectiles that the &1Blow Gun&0 use are called Blow &1Darts&0.
totemic.page.blowDart1=The list of different &1Blow Darts&0 you can get are the following. &1Poison darts&0, they will poison the target on impact for a few seconds. The &1Blaze Dart&0 will scorch and burn the target for a few seconds. And finally, the &1Antidote Dart&0 unlike other darts which usually try to harm will instead cure any poison the target has for a few seconds.
